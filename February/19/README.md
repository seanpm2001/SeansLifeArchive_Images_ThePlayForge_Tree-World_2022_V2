# Tree World 2022 February 19th session

## Sky glitch

<!-- Notes 2021.12.17
Sky glitch (own section in status file) occurs at branch 35-41, occurs only when scrolling down, resets once you go back down to branch 33, if you go slow enough, the glitch doesn't trigger
!-->

The sky glitch seems to occur at around branches 35 to 41, and only activates when scrolling down. It cuts the background out at this range, and only shows blackness. It resets once you go back down to branch 33. If you go slow enough the glitch doesn't trigger.

**Observations as of 2021, Friday, December 17th**

The glitch seems to also happen if you open the navbar of your device, even if you aren't scrolling in the game.

**This observation is as of 2021 , Sunday, December 26th**

## Critter duplication glitch

On 2021 Thursday December 23rd, I accidentally performed the critter duplication glitch by pressing the cancel button before it completely loaded. I got an extra Armadillo. I did not want to perform the glitch, I might evict the critter.

I started playing Tree World again today. Last night when doing research on the Play Forge company, this game caught my eyes, and I have now been able to confirm it was one of the older games I played back in my early childhood, for a decent amount of time.

Today, I focused on gameplay. I got my tree planted, and raised it up 13 branches. I rescued several animals, and made lots of progress. I had an extremely long session today. Originally, I thought it was going to be difficult to document and play, but it is really easy. The game wanted access to make phone calls, and I denied that. Luckily, it wasn't a requirement. They couldn't really do anything anyway, since my phones SIM card is completely corrupted, and no longer in the phone.

I plan to play again tomorrow, but I am going to have to work on playing for less time, as I am also actively working on fixing my schedule lately. - 2021 Wednesday December 1st

I started playing Tree World again today. Today, gameplay was a lot slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 15) and to expand to 16, I first have to feed the second tree egg for over 30000 tree food. I saved up over 10000 tree food, then quit. I wanted to have a shorter session today, but it still dragged on for a while. I still plan to play again tomorrow, but I am going to have to work harder on playing for less time, as I am also actively working on fixing my schedule lately. - 2021 Thursday December 2nd

I played Tree World for a 3rd consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was still a bit slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 17) a lot of the time was needed to hatch the 2nd tree egg. Once I reached branch 16, all fruit collected doubled in value. I saved up over 1000 tree food, then quit. I wanted to have a shorter session today, but it still dragged on for a while. I still plan to play again tomorrow, but I am going to have to work even harder on playing for less time, as I am also actively working on fixing my schedule lately. - 2021 Friday December 3rd

I played Tree World for a 4th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was still a bit slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 19) I did my first rescue mission today, I was forced to. I managed to quit early, as my battery ran low when I felt satisfied with my progress, so I was able to quit earlier.. - 2021 Saturday December 4th

I played Tree World for a 5th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a bit faster. I raised my tree up 4 branches (to branch 23) but did not expand the 23rd branch at all. I did my first rescue mission today, I originally decided not to, but decided to just go for it. I forgot how much tree food these missions reward. I also used the critter capsule machine and got 1 free crit. I quit after a nearly 2 hour session, as my battery ran low, and I felt like doing more another day. - 2021, Sunday, December 5th

I played Tree World for a65th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a lot slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. I did my third rescue mission today. I forgot how much tree food these missions reward. My starter critters were unable to level up today, as I didn't play until the time that they were originally rescued 5 days ago. I started work on an open source alternative to this game today as well. I quit after a nearly 2 hour session, as my battery ran low, and I felt like doing more another day. - 2021, Monday, December 6th

I played Tree World for a 7th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a lot slower. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I did not raise my tree up, and I had to quit before I could hatch the tree egg. I did my fourth rescue mission today. My starter critters leveled up today, I expected a massive amount of popups upon opening the application, but it was a lot better, I just upgraded them manually, individually. I earned my first vitagem from critter collection, and had a long session. I quit after a nearly 2 hour session, as my battery ran low, and I felt like doing more another day. - 2021, Tuesday, December 7th

I played Tree World for an 8th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was better, and I managed to stop myself earlier on. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I hatched the 3rd tree egg today, and raised my tree up 2 and a half branches. I did my fifth rescue mission today. My second day starter critters leveled up today, at first, it seemed like they weren't going to level up today, but they did, I just upgraded them manually, individually. I also upgraded the den twice today, the first 2 upgrades cost 5000 tree food each. After the first upgrade, I thought all the upgrades were going to cost the same or cost vitagems. After the 2nd upgrade, upgrades cost 10000 tree food each. I still don't have the exact pattern of costs nailed down, but the 12 extra slots I have will help me out, as I have been struggling to keep 1 species per branch.

Despite quitting early, I still had a along session, I just didn't drain my battery before quitting. I quit after a nearly 1 and a hakf hour session, I decided to quit. - 2021, Wednesday, December 8th

I played Tree World for a 9th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was better, and I managed to stop myself earlier on. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I hatched the 3rd tree egg today, and raised my tree up 3 and a half branches. I did my sixth rescue mission today. My third day starter critters leveled up today, at first, it seemed like they weren't going to level up today, but they did, I just upgraded them manually, individually. I played for an extensive period, as I felt like doing so. I drained the battery before quitting, and eventually quit after a nearly 2 and a half hour session. - 2021, Thursday, December 9th

I played Tree World for a 10th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was better, but the game crashed once. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 2 branches today. When the game crashed early on, tree food wasn't collectable, and all the textures were glitched. I had to restart the app. I heard of a bug where sometimes the game crashes and tree food and vita gems are swapped. I cannot confirm this still, and it didn't happen following the crash. I did my seventh rescue mission today. My fourth day starter critters leveled up today, at first, it seemed like they weren't going to level up today, but they did, I just upgraded them manually, individually. I played for an extensive period, as I felt like doing so. I drained the battery before quitting, and eventually quit after a nearly 2 and a half hour session. 

There were several things I forgot to mention yesterday, such as the fruit bonus increasing after reaching branch 30, and the fairy being unlocked at branch 30. The fairy is a paid option to auto-collect all tree food, but the first usage is free. I am unable to test it out further, and I don't feel like paying for it to trial it out yet, as I am saving up for other things first (as of today, I am 1 vitagem away from upgrading Pippy to level 3) 

Also today, I upgraded my den for a 3rd time for 10000 tree food, the fourth upgrade costs 20000, so the pattern broke again. - 2021, Friday, December 10th

I played Tree World for a 11th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was OK. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 2 branches today. I did my eighth rescue mission today, rescuing a panda. My fifth day starter critters leveled up today. I played for a shorter period of time, as I didn't have as much battery. I drained the battery before quitting, and eventually quit after a nearly 1 hour 45 minute session. 

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I also got to use the fairy for free again today, and got a limited critter from a capsule opening. I upgraded Pippy with 75 vitagems, thinking it would be the last upgrade. There is a 4th one that costs 200 vitagems. I later earned a vitagem from critter collection. The sky texture is a bit glitched, and I am wondering what will happen once I reach branch 36, if it will stay like this or not. - 2021, Saturday, December 11th

I played Tree World for a 12th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was OK. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 1 branch today. I did my ninth rescue mission today, rescuing a sprite. My sixth day starter critters leveled up today. I played for a shorter period of time, as I didn't have as much battery. I drained the battery before quitting, and eventually quit after a nearly 1 hour 30 minute session. 

I got distracted with the family cat at the beginning, she was in my room, and I had to pet her, so I didn't play as much for the first 20 minutes.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I also got to use the fairy for free again today, and I tried out the paid use. Apparently, it costs 2 vitagems per use, so it is completely not worth it, and you should just use the free cycle once a day. The sky texture is still bit glitched, and I am wondering what will happen once I reach branch 36, if it will stay like this or not.

Today, I reached the most expensive tree keeper to date, it costs over 300,000 tree food to hatch. I got a little over 18% done getting up to this cost, but it is going to take me 1-4 more days to get past it. I unlocked level 4 plants today, and am now at 13.62% (41/301) completion on the discovery of all critters. - 2021, Sunday, December 12th

I played Tree World for a 13th consecutive day today.

I did my tenth rescue mission today, rescuing a fox. My seventh day starter critters leveled up today. I played for a longer amount of time, but didn't completely drain my battery.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I also got to use the fairy (Patty) for free again (twice) today. I am still working on hatching the next tree keeper, I am over 62% done with it now. It will take 1-3 more days to save up for it. I did 1 adventure today, and got a duplicate critter. Out of the 4 new critters I received today, only one was previously undiscovered. I also earned 1 vitagem from tree collection. - 2021, Monday, December 13th

I played Tree World for a 14th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was OK, I started much earlier today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 1.5 branches today. I did my eleventh rescue mission today, rescuing a boar (my 2nd one). My eighth day starter critters leveled up today, at first I didn't think they were going to, but I received the option later on. I played for a longer amount of time, and drained my battery down to 2%.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I also got to use the fairy (Patty) for free again (once) today. I hatched the new tree keeper today, and struggled to raise the tree up further due to how much I spent on the tree keeper. It took me 3 sessions to hatch this tree egg. I did 1 adventure today, and got a duplicate critter. Out of the 5 new critters I received today, only three were previously undiscovered. I currently have 52 out of 301 critters, totaling 17.28% of all critter types collected. I paired up more critters today. I considered coming back to play again once my battery charged, but I decided notto. - 2021, Tuesday, December 14th

I played for a long time, but didn't drain the battery down below 6%

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I did not use the fairy at all today, and tree upgrades are becoming too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day.

I played for a long time, but didn't drain the battery down below 10% as I did not have an available battery to charge from, and I forced myself to quit earlier.

Over 26% to next branch

I played Tree World for a 24th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was again repetitive, I started a bit later today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 1 branch today, it costs over 200,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch, so this new branch a day process is definitely slowing down. I made it to branch 51 today. I did my twenty-first rescue mission today, rescuing a Seal (my 1st one). My eighteenth day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 1 starter critters (to level 3) there was a ton of leveling up in the beginning.. I played for a long time (over 2.02 hours) and quit after draining my battery.

After creating branch 51, the price of creating new branches doubled, and now it is much harder to keep going, so I upgraded my den twice just in case. My tree was still completely full, and I couldn't place 3 critters. The first upgrade today costs 20000, then the second cost 35000. The next one will cost 60000.

I used the critter capsule machine today. I am over 26% there for affording the next branch.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I did not use the fairy today, and tree upgrades are starting to become too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day. I was not able to do so today, only raising my tree up 1 branch. I did 1 adventure today. Out of the 6 new critters I received today, 4 were previously undiscovered. I currently have 86 out of 301 critters, totaling 28.57% of all critter types collected. - 2021, Friday, December 24th

I stayed with branch 51 today. I did my twenty-second rescue mission today, rescuing a Stegosaurus (my 1st one). My nineteenth day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 2 starter critters (to level 3) there was a lot less leveling up in the beginning compared to yesterday. I played for a lot less time today, as I started with less battery, and quit after draining my battery.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I did not use the fairy today, and tree upgrades are starting to become too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I used the fairy at the beginning today for convenience, and tree upgrades are starting to become too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day.

I used the critter capsule machine today. Today, I spent some time remodeling the first 20 branches of my tree, so that I would have 1 of each plant type. I plan to do the same for branch 21 to 25 when I unlock level 5 plants, then everything after that will be versatile in the future.

The game was very unstable today. The first time it bugged out, it refused to grow fruit, so I excited. One of my critters now has a weird loading icon upon each game reload.

I hope to re-receive it again, and not have the game delete it.

I played Tree World for a 38th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a lot shorter. I started a little later today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 0.75 branchES today. It costs over 362,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch, and another tree keeper is NOW ACTIVE, so this new branch a day process is definitely slowing down. I did my fortieth rescue mission today, rescuing a Koala (my 2nd one) My 32nd day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 15 starter critters (to level 3) there was a lot less leveling up in the beginning compared to yesterday. I played for a normal amount of time today, as I started with more battery, and quit after draining it to 5%. I split my second in 2, and did more collection later on, along with finalizing the move to branch 60. I also earned 1 vitagem from collection.

The adventure today gave out a pretty bad reward, but it really hasn't been much help in raising my tree up other than that. It didn't help out very much today. Today, I reached branch 60, and unlocked level 5 plants and versatile plants at the same time. Even though the level 5 plants give 5% more than the level 6 plants, I plan to only place level 6 plants from branch 26 and up to follow my design. I plan on getting 1 of each type of level 5 plant from branch 21 to 25, of which I have already done 2.

Today, I accidentally wasted 8 vitagems on a level 5 plant, as I didn't intend to place it where I did. Along with the tree upgrade, the fruit bonus increased from 1, 4, 20, 100, 200, and 400 to 1, 5, 25, 125, 250, and 500. It still has a maximum of 6 fruits that can be grown at once.

I reached the 5th tree keeper today. It is going to be difficult to get past, but it is not as bad as I expected. I expected it to be a lot more expensive (more like 1,000,000 or more tree food, rather than 800,754) it is still going to take me a few days to get past it.

I did not receive any new critters today. From the adventure, I received a Koala, which was a duplicate.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I did not use the fairy today. Tree upgrades are starting to become too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day. I was not able to do so today, only able to raise my tree up 0.75 branches. I did 1 adventure today. I currently have 112 out of 301 critters, totaling 37.21% of all critter types collected.

Legendary: 1/50 (02.00% of all types collected)

Limited: 5/60 (08.33% of all types collected)

I am still considering not summoning new critters each day due to not enough space. I did NOT summon new critters today, as I had no reasonable available space. <!-- I made progress on getting to a new branch today, I just didn't spend the tree food on expanding yet out of fear of the expansion being deleted.

I played Tree World for a 39th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a lot shorter. I started a lot later today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 0 today. It costs over 362,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch, and another tree keeper is NOW ACTIVE, so this new branch a day process is definitely slowing down. I did my forty-first rescue mission today, rescuing a SproutKid (my 1st one) My 33rd day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 16 starter critters (to level 3) there was a lot less leveling up in the beginning compared to yesterday. I played for a normal amount of time today, as I started with more battery, and quit after draining it to 6%. I split my second in 4, I intended to split it in 3, but the game wasn't functional the second time (ads weren't functional, which was what I was trying to go for, more on that below) and I ended up only getting 1 more offer for the day.

The adventure today gave out a pretty bad reward, but it really hasn't been much help in raising my tree up other than that. It didn't help out very much today. Today, I spent the rest of my Vitagems on versatile and level 5 branches, until I didn't have enough vitagems for anything. My branches are almost to the way I want them, I just need about 56 more Vitagems (not an exact calculation)

As hinted earlier, I began "watching" ads for vitagems. I should have made use of this earlier on. I appear to only be able to "watch" 5 ads per 24 hours.

I summoned critters today, but received only duplicates. I made use of them, and paired them up on my tree. I plan to upgrade my den repeatedly, until the upgrades cost more than the tree keeper. Today, I upgraded my den to 33 slots for 250,000 tree food. The next upgrade will cost 400,000 tree food, so I am going to stay at branch 60 for a while.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I used the fairy on purpose today just because I could. Tree upgrades are starting to become too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day. I was not able to do so today, only able to raise my tree up 0 branches. I did 1 adventure today. I currently have 113 out of 301 critters, totaling 37.54% of all critter types collected.

I played Tree World for a 42nd consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was extremely large in length. I started a lot earlier today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 1 branch today.

I could have done a 2nd adventure today, but decided not to.

The adventure today gave out a pretty bad reward, but it really hasn't been much help in raising my tree up other than that. It didn't help out very much today. Today, I spent the rest of my Vitagems on versatile and level 5 branches, finally reaching my goal.

Today, I decided not to upgrade my den. I decided to hatch the tree keeper instead, as I needed to progress. I unlocked a giraffe from the tree keeper, and raised up 1 more branch before quitting.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I used the fairy by accident today. Tree upgrades are starting to become too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day.

I played Tree World for a 69th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a bit shorter in length, but I was a bit more in control of the time today.

I did not watch 5 ads for 10 vitagems today, as I was unable to when the time came, and didn't want to go through the frustrating process of opening and closing the game repeatedly, and attempting over and over.

I started a lot earlier today, and split the session across multiple periods. I was going to have 1 more session, but decided not to.

During my first session today, I worked on my Tree World Wiki project while playing, so it may have seemed like a sporadic session. I went and documented the names of every critter I have unlocked, along with 3 extras. This Wiki project is new, and due to it, it motivated me to play for over an hour on my first session today.

I did not use the fairy today. I also did 1 adventure today, getting a second caterpillow. I currently have 133 out of 301 critters, totaling 44.19% of all critter types collected.

Other current critter stats:

Common: 47/62 (75.81% of all types collected)

Uncommon: 46/65 (70.77% of all types collected)

Rare: 30/64 (46.87% of all types collected)

Legendary: 3/50 (06.00% of all types collected)

Limited: 6/60 (10.00% of all types collected)

Recently, I have been summoning critters and doing adventures again. I want to keep progress going, and have a more full den. It still feels a little disappointing to fall behind on the animals on tree to den capacity ratio. <!-- I made progress on getting to a new branch today, I just didn't spend the tree food on expanding yet out of fear of the expansion being deleted.

I played Tree World for 79th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a lot longer in length, but I was a bit more in control of the time today. I started a bit earlier today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 0.5 branches today. It costs over 700,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch, so this new branch a day process is definitely slowing down. <!-- I did my fortieth rescue mission today, rescuing a Blue Bird (my 1st one) !--> I decided to let loose and summon critters and do an adventure yet again today. From the adventure, I got a decent amount of tree food, and unlocked a second kangaroo mouse. When summoning critters, I discovered 1 critter: Echidna. My 71st day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 62 starter critters (to level 3) there was a lot less leveling up in the beginning compared to yesterday. I split across several sessions yet again today. <!-- I have a new system to play for less than 25 minutes per day.!-->
